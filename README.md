# AccountingLedger

This project consisted of creating an Accounting Ledger application that allows users to submit and track their payments and deposit history with multiple vendors. 

## Home Screen

When the program starts, the user is greeted and shown this screen. User can opt to submit a payment or deposit, access the ledger, or simply close/exit the program.
